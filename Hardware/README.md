### Schematic
Schematic files are available in `Schematic.pdf` as well as Altium source files.
This file should be enough to understand how things are connected and how hardware works.

Bill of Material is available in `Bill of Materials.pdf`.
Most parts are interchangeable, so feel free to source these parts from your favorite part distributor.
When replacing capacitors, make sure you choose the same voltage rating!

### How can I order the PCB

I have prepared Gerber files that are verified and ready to go. You can take `Release\2023-04-29_14-32_DryBox_R1\2023-04-29_14-32_DryBox_R1_Gerber.zip` and upload it to your favorite PCB manufactuer like PCBWay, SeeedStudio, JLCPCB etc.
There are no critical PCB specs, so you can select whichever one you prefer.
For your reference, the specifications for the PCBs that I have ordered are listed below.
